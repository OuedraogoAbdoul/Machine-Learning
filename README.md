1 -  Naive Bayes Classifier for Text Classification

This repo contains a set of applied machine learning tutorials. Feel free to make improvements. I will attempt to consistently upload projects. If you have request or would like me to cover a specific algorithm let me know.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any package. At the moment, the code is using build in libraries from python. I will upload an environment file if the libraries change.

```bash
pip install package-name
```

## Usage

If you need to import library, use command such as:

```python
import foobar
```

## Contributing
